### Gaming for the Arch-minded

Gaming on Linux used to involve blood sacrifices and recompiling kernels. This script mostly avoids the occult by automating the installation of an array of tools you may or may not need.

#### Requirements:
- `yay`: If it's not installed, the script won't work.
- Read it: This script covers most everything a discerning Arch gamer might want. Adjust/edit the script as you see fit.

#### The Ritual:

1. **Make it Executable:** `chmod +x gaming_pack_installer.sh`
2. **Run it:** `./gaming_pack_installer.sh`
3. **Reboot:** Otherwise the group mods won't take effect

#### Notes:
You cannot run this as *root* because the script uses `yay` for some of the packages.
