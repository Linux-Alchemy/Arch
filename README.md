### I Use Arch (BTW) :trollface: 

> *Welcome to the repository where I curate my specific brand of digital wizardry.*

### Overview

This repository serves as the central nervous system for my Arch Linux experiments, configurations, and my ongoing efforts to make a computer do what I tell it to, and nothing more.

It is based on a simple premise: 

If I wanted an operating system that treats me like a toddler, asks "Are you sure?" every time I touch a system file, and harvests my data to sell me toaster ovens, I’d be on Windows. If I wanted an OS that forces proprietary Snap packages down my throat like a goose destined for foie gras, I’d be using Ubuntu.


### What You'll Find Here 📓

This is not a "distro." This is a collection of logic, scripts, and documentation for building systems that don't suck.

* **The Manual Build (Linux Black):** A complete autopsy of a system built from scratch. It utilizes Btrfs, Snapper, and AppArmor. It serves as a reminder that while `archinstall` exists, understanding the plumbing is the only way to fix the toilet when it backs up.
* **The Unholy Experiments:** Because "just doing things" is the best way to figure stuff out.


### A Note on "Instability"

You will hear people say Arch is unstable. These are often the same folks who copy-paste `sudo` commands from Reddit.

Arch is not unstable; it is **indifferent**. It assumes you read the news, check your config files, and possess a basic level of literacy. If that sounds like too much work, Canonical is that way ➡️

Disclaimer: _These configurations work perfectly on my machine. If you run them on yours and your GPU catches fire, I will not buy you a new GPU._
